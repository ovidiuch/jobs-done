  - [x] Configure Cosmos with react-native-web
  - [x] Configure ESLint with react-native-web
  - [x] Configure CRNA
  - [x] Convert existing UI to react-native components
  - [ ] Fix background in native environments

  - [ ] Edit button
- [ ] Register page (opened on Edit as guest)

Nice to have:
